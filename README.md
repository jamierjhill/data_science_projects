# data_science_projects

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! Below, you will find a list of projects categorized by data science techniques and methodologies.

1. Supervised Learning
Classification: Predict categorical labels.
Example: Wine classification using the load_wine dataset.
Regression: Predict continuous values.
Example: Predicting house prices based on features like location and size.

2. Unsupervised Learning
Clustering: Group data into clusters based on similarity.
Example: Customer segmentation for marketing strategies.
Dimensionality Reduction: Reduce the number of features while retaining key information.
Example: PCA for visualizing high-dimensional data.

3. Deep Learning
Image Classification: Use CNNs to classify images.
Example: Classify cats vs dogs using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Analyze and generate text.
Example: Sentiment analysis or chatbot creation.

4. Time Series Analysis
Stock Forecasting: Predict stock prices using ARIMA or LSTM models.
Weather Forecasting: Build models to predict future weather conditions using APIs.

5. Reinforcement Learning
Game AI: Develop bots that learn to play games.
Example: Training an agent to play Tic-Tac-Toe using Q-learning.

6. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data Exploration: Visualize, clean, and summarize datasets.
Example: Analysis of housing market trends or COVID-19 data.
