# data_science_projects

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! Below is a categorized list of data science project types that this folder will contain (eventually).

1. Supervised Learning - Predict outcomes using labeled datasets.
   Examples: Energy Forecaster using xGBoost

3. Unsupervised Learning - Identify patterns and groupings in unlabeled data.

4. Deep Learning - Use neural networks to solve complex problems like image recognition or natural language processing.

5. Time Series Analysis - Analyze and forecast data points over time.
   Examples: Flight Passengers using ETS Holt Winters.

7. Reinforcement Learning - Train models to make decisions by interacting with their environment.

8. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Explore, visualize, and summarize data to uncover insights.
